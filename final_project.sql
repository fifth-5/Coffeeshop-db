Stored Procedure
Code a SPROC that uses a combination of Cursor, Loop, If Statement (or Case Statement) and necessary select statement(s) against the database to calculate a value

Use the Call Statement to execute the SPROC
If your SROC takes in a parameter value, then call the SPROC with a parameter value
